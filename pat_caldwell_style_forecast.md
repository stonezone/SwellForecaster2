Midday Monday shows Country in the low-moderate range with energy from 310-330 degrees at 11-14s intervals. Town offers small-scale surf from background SSW energy combined with local east windswell at select refracting spots.

On this date, 05/12, in the historical H1/10 surf observation database for Oʻahu's North Shore, the average is 4.2 Hs (8' peak face, Oʻahu Surf Climatology) and the largest recorded was 12 Hs (24' peak face) in 1997.

## Moon's View
Mid May transitioning pattern showing NPAC storm track retreating northward as expected for the season. South Pacific beginning to show more consistent activity for Town.

## Buoy Status

NOAA SW Hawaii buoy 51002 showing 1.2 ft @ 14s from 190° with trace signal at 18s, indicating potential small background SSW pulse.

## Current Systems & Forecast

### North Pacific (Country)
**Aleutian System 5/09-5/11**  
*Backstory:*  
Phase 1: Low developed near 45N, 170W reaching 984mb with gale-to-storm force winds generating 320-330° swell.  
Phase 2: System tracking eastward along Aleutian chain 5/10-5/11, maintaining partial fetch aimed at Hawaiian targets.

*Prognosis:*  
Current energy should hold in the 4-6' face range with slow decline through Tuesday.

**Western Pacific System 5/11-5/13**  
New low forming near Kurils 5/11, expected to deepen to 972mb with well-aimed fetch nosing to within a favorable 2000nm from Hawaiian targets.

*Prognosis:*  
Energy from this source will arrive Wednesday 5/14, building to slightly above average levels (5-7' faces) from 305-320° at 14-16s by Thursday.

### South Pacific (Town)
**New Zealand Storm Track 5/05-5/08**  
*Backstory:*  
Mixed sea state has been delivering background energy from 170-190° at 14-17s over past several days.

*Current status:*  
Trace-to-small surf from S (180-190°) at 1-3' faces for Town spots.

**Tasmania System 5/09-5/11**  
*Backstory:*  
Classic captured fetch S of Tasmania with storm-force winds 5/09-5/10 showed good duration but less than optimal aim at Hawaiian targets.

*Prognosis:*  
Energy from this source should arrive Tuesday-Wednesday with small-scale surf from 195-205° at 16-18s. Select spots could see 2-3' faces during peak periods.

## Into the long range
Let's see what Wooly Worm is up to. Gathering leaves at the compost heap on Monday, arranging them in southerly arcs. Wooly's got that knowing look.

That southerly arc arrangement may be a sign - notch up for Town by weekend 5/17-5/18. Models show system developing near 50S, 150W 5/12-5/13 with potential captured fetch setting up favorably for Hawaiian targets.

Meanwhile, NPAC patterns suggest continued eastward progression of storm tracks with decreasing magnitudes typical of the season. Country likely to see average-to-below activity in the 8-15 day range.
